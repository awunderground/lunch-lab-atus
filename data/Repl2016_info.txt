
The data file atuswgts_2016.dat (2016 Replicate weights file) contains 322 variables and 24,336 records.  The variables are:  TUCASEID, 
FINLWGT001...FINLWGT160, BWGT001...BWGT160, and TUBWGT.  TUCASEID is defined in the ATUS Interview Data Dictionary, 
available at:  https://www.bls.gov/tus/atusintcodebk16.pdf.  FINLWGT001...FINLWGT160 and BWGT001...BWGT160 are 
replicate weights.  TUBWGT refers to the base weights (or basic weights); base weights are the inverse of a 
respondent's probability of selection. 

In addition to the data file, three computer programs are contained in atuswgts_2016.zip. If you have SPSS, SAS, 
or Stata software, you may use these programs to read the data into your statistical software package.  

The file "atuswgts_2016.sps" reads the data into SPSS; some variable names exceed length 8.

The file "atuswgts_2016.sas" reads the data into SAS.

The file "atuswgts_2016.do" reads the data into Stata.

If you have SAS, SPSS, or Stata software, open the corresponding program, edit the infile (in SAS), 
file (in SPSS) or import (in Stata) statement to reference the data file on your computer, and run the program.

The ATUS replicate weights are based on the replicate weights developed for the CPS. ATUS begins with the CPS 
replicate weight after the first-stage ratio adjustment.  Each replicate is processed through all of the stages of 
the ATUS weighting procedure.  The CPS replicate weights are based on a modified balanced half-sample method of 
replication, developed in the 1980s by Robert Fay.
